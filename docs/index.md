# Interview Handbook for Machine Learning

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
I am still working on this. Yet to do a lot of organization and add more relevant information. 

## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Engineer with more than 8 years of working experience in the area of Deep Learning, Computer Vision. Over the years I have worked with some very well known institutions(IIT Kanpur, IIIT Delhi) and organizations(Mu Sigma Inc., Quantela Inc., Aditya Birla Group) researching, learning, and building Computer Vision applications.

## What is this?

I have collated this handbook with questions that I came across from the following resources:

1. My experience in giving and taking interviews over the years. 
2. My practical experience in the area of Deep Learning, Computer Vision.
3. Reading Research Papers, Online Blogs, Articles etc.
2. Questions I came across when pursuing online courses:
    1. [Coursera Deep Learning Specilization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
    2. [CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)


## What this is NOT?
This is not a complete guide for Machine Learning/Deep Learning but it could just serve as reference.

## A few things to note
* For very simple, obvious question, I have not attempted to "reinvent the wheel" instead I have put up some great articles that I found online while doing preparation for interviews.
* As such, I do not see any order or sequence in the questions, each question is mostly independent of the others.
* According to some reader, some concepts present in one section should be present in other section. I'd say there is a thin line between such concepts. When compiling this handbook, I may have thought to put it that way.
* I have read a lot of resources online and tried to cite them as well at most of the places possible. In case you find that the text belongs to some blog, article or a course and I forgot to mention, please feel free to raise an issue in the github repo.
